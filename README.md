Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

**Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.**
    software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
    
    provides a structured approach to developing reliable, efficient, and scalable software systems fostering innovations and   
    making people's work easier
    
**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**
    mastering complexity
    Mastering proces
    Mastering machine

**List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**
    planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
    requirement analysis - identify the final user specification.
    design - building the framework.
    coding - converting software design into source code.
    testing - examine the software for bugs 

**Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**
  In Waterfall methodology, each phase is completed before moving on, no flexibility, It is hard to make changes once a phase has completed.Testing is done when the project has been aready been completed.
In Agile methodology, is iterative with multiple cycles. It is flexible to changes, testing is done after each iteration.

**Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.**
Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement and making sure it meets the standards.
Project Manager - assembles and leads the software development team making sure each and everyone is doing their roles are it is expected of them.

**Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.**
IDE provides a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts.
Version Control systems help software teams manage changes to source code over timeallowing reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors

**What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges**.
rapid technological advancement: 
  Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. 
Time Constraints:
  Solution: adopt agile methodologies to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints

**Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance**.
  Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
  Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
  Help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
  System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
  It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
  Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors.
Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.

**#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering**


**Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.**
prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance: Improved user experience and more accurate responses


**Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.**

Vague prompt: create a cv for me

accurate prompt: Make a cv for a beginner software engineer with one year experience at Google. Has a bachelors in comp science from Harvard and is good in data structures.
